**************************           HELP           **************************
This is the help file. 
There's not much here, yet, because the game is incomplete.

The following commands are currently available:

	help		-	This help file.
	lusers		-	List all users currently connected.
	quit!		-	Disconnect from the server.
	chist		-	Show chat history.
	say			-	Broadcast message to local users.

More commands are coming soon. Until then, you can use this as a CLI chat-
room, just type whatever you want to say.
